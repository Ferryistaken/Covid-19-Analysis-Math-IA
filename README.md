# Covid-19-Analysis-Math-IA
This contains a jupyter notebook which I used to analyze data used in my Mathematical Exploration for the IB programme 


## Also useful for other projects
The first part of this notebook(up to the 6th cell) just [official data from the Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and puts in in an SQL (sqlite3) database using sqlalchemy. Using this notebook you can put the data in an organized database for further analysis
